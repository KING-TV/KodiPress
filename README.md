*KodiPress* is an experimental project that aims to create a user-friendly web interface for Kodi (formerly XBMC). It  combines the following technologies:

- The built-in [JSON RPC API](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API)
- [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
- A handful of jQuery plugins

### An Experiment?

This is experimental in the sense that I'm building this for myself. I get the opportunity to learn more about WordPress theme development and other technologies that I'm not necessarily familiar with.
